Test on a fresh windows VM

Test on linux

uninstall needs a progress bar of some sort.
the desktop .lnk and .desktop shortcut doesn't delete themselves when uninstalling at least on linux, need to check on windows as well.
the folder in appdata/roaming ins't deleted and the folder in appdata/local.

The timer in linux doesn't show when downloading

Maybe change the timer into a countdown.

when the game is first downloaded and extracted I did'nt see v1.0.0 at the bottom right where it shows the game and launcher version, double check.

it would be nice if i could see the download speed

it would be nice to see the total downloads in the tens instead of just the hundreds when downloading in the GBs. for example, "4.5 GB/7.4 GB downloaded" to "4.53 GB/7.42 GB downloaded

when the launcher is extracting and i close it in wine using linux it doesn't show the extract button state and goes straight to the update state
